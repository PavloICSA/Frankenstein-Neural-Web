# Product Overview

Frankenstein Neural Web is a fully functional artificial neural network that combines WebAssembly SIMD, C, and JavaScript to create a browser-based machine learning application with a Frankenstein laboratory theme.

## Core Functionality

- Train neural networks on CSV datasets (1-10 input features)
- Three-layer architecture: input layer (1-10 neurons), hidden layer (6 neurons), output layer (1 neuron)
- Gradient descent with backpropagation for training
- Interactive web interface for data upload, training, and predictions
- Dark terminal aesthetic with neon green styling

## Key Differentiators

- Performance-critical operations implemented with WebAssembly SIMD intrinsics
- Runs natively in browsers via WebAssembly (no server-side processing)
- Educational focus: demonstrates low-level ML implementation
